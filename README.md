### Question 1 Achieving 1NF (First Normal Form) 🛠️
Task:
- You are given the following table **ProductDetail**:

| OrderID | CustomerName  | Products                        |
|---------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| 101     | John Doe      | Laptop, Mouse                   |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Tablet, Keyboard, Mouse         |
| 103     | Emily Clark   | Phone                           |


- In the table above, the **Products column** contains multiple values, which violates **1NF**.
- **Write an SQL query** to transform this table into **1NF**, ensuring that each row represents a single product for an order
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders(
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
first_name VARCHAR(30),
second_name VARCHAR(30));

INSERT INTO orders(order_id, first_name, second_name) 
VALUES (101, "John", "Doe"), (102 , "Jane", "Smith"),
(103, "Emily", "Clark");

SELECT * FROM orders;

CREATE TABLE products(
product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
product_name VARCHAR(30),
order_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id));

INSERT INTO products(product_name, order_id) 
VALUES ("Laptop", 101), ("Mouse", 101),
("Tablet", 102), ("Keyboard", 102), ("Mouse", 102),
("Phone", 103);

SELECT * FROM products;
DROP TABLE products;
```

### Question 2 Achieving 2NF (Second Normal Form) 🧩

- You are given the following table **OrderDetails**, which is already in **1NF** but still contains partial dependencies:

| OrderID | CustomerName  | Product      | Quantity |
|---------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| 101     | John Doe      | Laptop       | 2        |
| 101     | John Doe      | Mouse        | 1        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Tablet       | 3        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Keyboard     | 1        |
| 102     | Jane Smith    | Mouse        | 2        |
| 103     | Emily Clark   | Phone        | 1        |

- In the table above, the **CustomerName** column depends on **OrderID** (a partial dependency), which violates **2NF**. 

- Write an SQL query to transform this table into **2NF** by removing partial dependencies. Ensure that each non-key column fully depends on the entire primary key.
